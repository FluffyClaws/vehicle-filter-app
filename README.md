# Vehicle Filter App

A web application that allows users to select a vehicle make and model year, then displays the available vehicle models for the chosen make and year. The app interacts with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) API to fetch vehicle information.

## Features

- **Select Vehicle Make and Year**: Users can select a car make and model year to view available vehicle models.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Vehicle makes and model data are dynamically fetched from the NHTSA API.
- **Client-Side Rendering with Suspense**: Uses Reactâ€™s Suspense API to handle loading states and asynchronous data fetching on the client-side.
- **Responsive UI**: The user interface is fully responsive and optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. It follows the following structure:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Data is fetched on the server to pre-render the page with vehicle makes and model names before it's sent to the client.
- **Client-Side Fetching**: Vehicle models are fetched on the client-side using React's `useEffect` to allow for dynamic updates.
- **Environment Variables**: API URLs are stored securely in a `.env.local` file to separate configuration from code.
